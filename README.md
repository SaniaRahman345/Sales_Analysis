# Sales_Analysis 
## Project Overview 
The Diwali Sales Analysis project leverages Python's powerful data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, to delve into the sales performance during the festive season. Using Pandas, we efficiently manage and clean the dataset, ensuring data integrity. Matplotlib and Seaborn come into play for insightful visualizations, illustrating trends, peak sales periods, and product preferences. NumPy facilitates numerical computations for deeper insights.

This comprehensive project involves data preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical metrics and graphical representations. Seasonal patterns and sales trends during Diwali are uncovered through custom visualizations. The correlation between different variables is explored, aiding in strategic decision-making. Python's versatile libraries empower us to generate actionable insights, helping businesses optimize their Diwali sales strategies based on data-driven conclusions.

### Importing Libraries 
Open a Jupyter Notebook and start a new cell. To import a library, use the import keyword followed by the library name. For example, import pandas imports the Pandas library.
Multiple Imports:
Import multiple libraries in a single cell by separating them with commas. For example, import pandas as pd, numpy as np imports both Pandas and NumPy.
Specific Functions/Classes:
If you only need specific functions or classes from a library, import them using from library_name import function_name. For instance, from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression imports only the Linear Regression class from scikit-learn.
Autocomplete and Documentation:
Jupyter Notebook offers autocomplete functionality. Type the library or alias name, followed by a dot, and press 'Tab' to see available functions. Additionally, use ? after a function or library name for quick access to documentation within Jupyter.
### Data loading 
To load data into a Jupyter Notebook from your local system, you can use Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library.
Replace 'path/to/your/abc_file.csv' with the actual path and file name of your dataset. This example assumes a CSV file, but Pandas supports various file formats (e.g., Excel, SQL, etc.), and you can use pd.read_ followed by the file format (e.g., pd.read_excel, pd.read_sql) accordingly.
#### Data Cleaning  
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, ensuring that the dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. Here are the typical steps involved in data cleaning:

Handling Missing Values:
Identify and handle missing data by either removing rows/columns or imputing values based on the context. Pandas provides methods like dropna() and fillna() for this purpose.

Handling Duplicates:
Check for and remove duplicate records to avoid skewing analysis results. The drop_duplicates() method in Pandas can be used for this.

Correcting Data Types:
Ensure that data types are appropriate for each variable. Use Pandas' astype() method to convert data types, especially when reading from external sources like CSV files.

Dealing with Outliers:
Identify and handle outliers that may distort analysis results. Techniques like winsorizing, transforming, or removing outliers can be applied based on the nature of the data.

Standardizing/Normalizing Data:
Standardize or normalize numerical data to bring it to a common scale. This is particularly important when working with algorithms sensitive to the scale of features.

Handling Inconsistent Data:
Address inconsistencies in categorical data by standardizing values or merging categories. Correcting typos and standardizing formats is essential.

Addressing Typos and Inconsistent Formatting:
Look for typos, inconsistent formatting, or variations in categorical data and standardize them. This ensures uniformity and accuracy in the dataset.

Feature Engineering:
Create new features or transform existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. This step may involve creating dummy variables, deriving new features, or combining existing ones.

Handling Data Integrity Issues:
Ensure data integrity by cross-verifying relationships between variables. This may involve checking for logical inconsistencies or dependencies.

Documenting Changes:
Document all the changes made during the data cleaning process. This documentation is crucial for transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

Remember that the specific steps and techniques applied during data cleaning can vary based on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis. Regular exploratory data analysis (EDA) is often performed in conjunction with data cleaning to gain insights and guide the cleaning process.
##### Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
In this process we will explore all the data and analyses it using various techniques like plot the data using different visualization libraries of python. 
Step:1 
check all the columns names. 
step2: 
use countplot to count the number of gender in the category of male and female.
step3:
use the bar plot to check the age group of male and female category.
step4:
checking their stats and material status.
step5:
plot the count of occupation that higer number of people are joined and performing the sales.
step6:
then find the product cateory whose sale is higer in demand.
step7:
and lasting the product_id which product is highly catched the buyer attentions.
###### Conclusion:
Married Womens age group 26-35 years from UTAR Pardesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka working in IT sector, Healthcare and Aviation
are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing&Apparel and electronics & Gadgets cateories.
